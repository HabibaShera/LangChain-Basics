# LangChain Concepts & Examples

This repository contains practical notebooks demonstrating key concepts and capabilities of [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/). It is designed as a growing collection of examples to help developers and learners understand how to work with LangChain tools effectively in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ“˜ What's Inside

Currently, the repo includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

### 1. `Langchain-PromptTemplates.ipynb`
- Learn how to use LangChain's `PromptTemplate` for consistent prompt engineering.
- Includes 2â€“3 hands-on cases showcasing dynamic input variables and reusable templates.

### 2. `LangChain_Output_Parsing.ipynb`
- Explore structured output parsing with LangChainâ€™s `StructuredOutputParser` and `ResponseSchema`.
- Realistic examples including parsing model responses into JSON with sentiment analysis.

More notebooks covering different LangChain features will be added regularly.

## ðŸ§  Goals

- Build a reference collection of LangChain use cases.
- Help developers avoid common pitfalls with LangChain tools.
- Provide clear, reproducible examples using `prompt templates`, `output parsing`, and more.
